% clusterDetections

% This function merges multiple detections suspected to be of the same vehicle to a single detection.
% The function looks for detections that are closer than the size of a vehicle.
% Detections that fit this criterion are considered a cluster and are merged to a single detection
% at the centroid of the cluster.
% The measurement noises are modified to represent the possibility that each detection can be anywhere on the vehicle.
% Therefore, the noise should have the same size as the vehicle size.

% In addition, this function removes the third dimension of the measurement (the height) and
% reduces the measurement vector to [x;y;vx;vy].
